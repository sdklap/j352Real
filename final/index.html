To quote fashion superstar Heidi Klum, “One day you’re in, the next day you’re out.” A phrase could not more perfectly describe the recent phenomenon of microtrends.</p>
<p>A microtrend is a specific, prevailing aesthetic or item that usually lasts between three and six months, sometimes even less. This quickening of the trend cycle has led to overconsumption and fast fashion becoming even more popular since the pandemic began in 2020. 
</p>
<br>

<h3>Pandemic Perpetuation</h3>
<br>
<p>Fashion trends tend to run in 20 year cycles. For example, the early 2000’s y2k vibe has taken over the 2020’s with full force. With that always comes new trends, like low rise jeans and dresses over jeans in the y2k era.</p>
<p>Now, with the growing influence of social media in our lives since the COVID-19 pandemic began, the trend cycle has grown shorter and shorter. COVID left much of the population in isolation, leading to the increased usage of social media like Tik Tok and Instagram. Because Tik Tok and Instagram provide a platform for anyone to become an influencer, the apps create competition between users to promote the best, newest, and freshest content. Tik Tok user @thealgorythem even compared microtrends to a form of entertainment.
</p>
<p>The first major microtrend that was popularized by Tik Tok was the <a href="https://www.houseofsunny.co.uk/product-page/hockney-dress"> House of Sunny Green Hockney Dress</a>. It was as if everyone’s For You pages were cluttered with influencers reviewing this dress. From small creators with less than 1,000 followers to those with over a million, everyone had it. If they didn’t have this dress, they had a dupe, a less expensive rip-off version of it.</p>

</figure></center>
<p>As the pandemic continues, more and more microtrends are becoming relevant. Right now, the <a href="https://www.zara.com/us/en/satin-effect-cut-out-dress-p02662331.html?v1=157177891&v2=2026605">pink Zara satin effect cut out dress</a> has a chokehold over influencers and consumers. The timeline above doesn’t even have every microtrend, just 12 out of the at least 50 in the last two years. </p>

<h3>From the Runway to the Web</h3>
<br>
<p>Microtrends have even penetrated the world of high fashion with full-look policies. For example, Miu Miu does not let consumers borrow just the Micro Mini Skirt, it needs to be paired with the matching top or corresponding sweater. This is why it seems like every celebrity and influencer is wearing the same clothes.</p>

<br>
<p>In the past, trends have been derived from upscale designers. Meryl Streep’s character Miranda Priestly in “The Devil Wears Prada” explains it perfectly in her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja2fgquYTCg">iconic scene</a> about cerulean blue. After explaining how the color showed up in collections like Oscar De La Renta 2002 and Yves Saint Laurant, she states, </p>
<blockquote>“Then it filtered down through the department stores, and then trickled on down into some tragic casual corner where you, no doubt, fished it out of some clearance bin.” </blockquote>
<p>Now, influencers and celebrities are creating microtrends based on specific items and aesthetics from designer collections.

<h3>Fast Fashion, It's Going Quick</h3>
<p>Despite the relevance of high fashion in microtrends, fast fashion has been reigning supreme recently. Brands like Shein, DHgate, AliExpress, and Romwe are all able to quickly replicate styles and garments that are trending, whereas high fashion designer brands take longer to produce trending items of clothing.</p> 
<p>This extremely cheap and available style of clothing allows consumers to stay on trend but not spend thousands of dollars on a new wardrobe every month, thus making fast fashion the perfect solution. Many consumers are willing to sacrifice quality for quantity and price as well. </p>
<p>Corporations are producing hundreds of thousands of new styles every year, which is absolutely insane. The amount of overproduction and consumption of these fast fashion microtrends ultimately leads to severe environmental damage. </p>

<center><figcaption>Data from Business of Fashion</figcaption></center>
<br>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, more and more fabric is wasted every year. They report that in 2018, about <b>17 million</b> tons of textiles were wasted. That equates to the weight of more than <b>11 million</b> average sized cars. </p>
<p>This overconsumption of fast fashion brought on by microtrends is hugely damaging to the environment. There are also not many ways other than thrifting to shop sustainably while not having a lot of money. Even when thrifting, a mass of the clothes seen in thrift stores are discarded microtrends from fast fashion brands. </p>
<p>A great way to have a more sustainable wardrobe is to build your own personal style. Only owning clothes that you will wear long-term prevents overconsumption and lets you have fun with your wardrobe. While you can obviously enjoy and participate in trends, it is important to think about your impact on the environment in the long term.</p>
